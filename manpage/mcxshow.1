.SH NAME
mcxshow \- a 3D previewer for MCX/MCXCL/MMC photon transport simulations
.SH SYNOPSIS
mcxshow <-f input.json>
.SH DESCRIPTION
MCX Show is an OpenGL based 3D renderer for previewing photon simulation domain
settings in mcx/mmc. Monte Carlo eXtreme (mcx) and Mesh-based Monte Carlo (mmc) arerigirously validated, physically-accurate and GPU-accelerated 3D photon transportsimulators. The MCX/MMC simulators are developed by Dr. Qianqian Fang at theComputational Optics and Translational Imaging (COTI) Lab, at NortheasternUniversity, Boston, USA. More details regarding mcx/mmc can be found at http://mcx.space

.SH OPTIONS
If `mcxshow` command is executed without parameter, it opens a blank window, and
user can click on the toolbar to load a .json MCX/MCXCL input file to render.

However, one can also use the below options to load a default input file:

.TP
\fB-f/--json\fR
.TP
Use `-f` or `--json` flag to specify an MCX/MCXCL JSON-based input file.
Specifically, mcxshow looks for the `Shapes` and `Optodes` objects in the
root of the JSON data structure, and plots the 3D domain geometries in an OpenGL
window.
