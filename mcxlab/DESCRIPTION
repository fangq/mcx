Description:  MCXLAB is the native MEX version of MCX (https://mcx.space) 
 for MATLAB and GNU Octave. It compiles the entire MCX code into a MEX 
 function which can be called directly inside MATLAB or Octave. All input 
 and output files in MCX are replaced by convenient in-memory struct 
 variables in MCXLAB, thus, making it much easier to use and interact. 
 MATLAB/Octave also provides convenient plotting and data analysis functions. 
 With MCXLAB, your analysis can be streamlined and speed-up without involving 
 accessing disk files. This toolbox requires NVIDIA GPUs and graphics drivers.
