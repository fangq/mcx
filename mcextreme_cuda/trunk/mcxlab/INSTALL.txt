= Additional Installation Notes =

=== For Ubuntu users: ===

Because the Octave mex binaries were compiled on two CentOS 
workstations (i386 and x86_64), the library names may be 
slightly different from Ubuntu's default installation.
To use these mex files on your Octave, you need to install the 
following libraries on your Ubuntu machine:

  sudo apt-get install libblas3gf libhdf5-serial-1.8.4 libgfortran3

then create the following links:

  sudo ln -sf /usr/lib/libblas.so.3gf /usr/lib/libblas.so.3
  sudo ln -sf /usr/lib/libhdf5.so.6.0.3 /usr/lib/libhdf5.so.0
  sudo ln -sf /usr/lib/libgfortran.so.3.0.0 /usr/lib/libgfortran.so.1


=== For 64bit Windows 7 users: ===

The MATLAB mex file was compiled with CUDA toolkit 3.2. You must
install CUDA 3.2 or above to run the mex file. All others were 
compiled against CUDA toolkit 2.3, and are compatible with CUDA 
version equal or newer than 2.3.
