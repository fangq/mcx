= Additional Installation Notes =

One can manually install mcxlab by simply unzip the mcxlab zip file and use command
`addpath('/path/to/mcxlab/')` to install it for Octave/MATLAB.

Alternatively, for Windows, if you run the Windows all-in-one installer, the mcxlab
toolbox, along with other toolboxes are automatically added to your MATLAB path,
and can be used immediately.

If you use Linux, you can also install these packages via the official software
repositories

=== For Ubuntu/Debian users ===

Please add the fangq/ppa repository (https://launchpad.net/~fangq/+archive/ubuntu/ppa) 
to your system via

  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:fangq/ppa
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install octave-mcxlab matlab-mcxlab

When opening Octave, one must run
  pkg load mcxlab

to load mcxlab toolbox if installed via the official octave-mcxlab package.

=== For Fedora users ===

The official octave-mcxlab package supported on Fedora since F24 is not the 
CUDA version of MCXLAB, but MCXLAB-CL for OpenCL.
