.SH NAME
mcxviewer \- a 3D NIfTI/MC2 volumetric data renderer for MCX/MCXCL/MMC photon transport simulations
.SH SYNOPSIS
mcxviewer <-f input.nii>
.SH DESCRIPTION
MCX Viewer is an OpenGL based 3D renderer for visualization of the volumetric output
from MCX/MCXCL/MMC. Monte Carlo eXtreme (mcx) and Mesh-based Monte Carlo (mmc) arerigirously validated, physically-accurate and GPU-accelerated 3D photon transportsimulators. The MCX/MMC simulators are developed by Dr. Qianqian Fang at theComputational Optics and Translational Imaging (COTI) Lab, at NortheasternUniversity, Boston, USA. More details regarding mcx/mmc can be found at http://mcx.space

.SH OPTIONS
If `mcxviewer` command is executed without parameter, it opens a blank window, and
user can click on the toolbar to load a .mc2/.nii MCX/MCXCL volumetric output fileto render.

However, one can also use the below options to load a default input file:

.TP
\fB-f/--file\fR
.TP
Use `-f` or `--file` flag to specify an MCX/MCXCL .nii output file.
Currently, only 32-bit floating point data are accepted (default output format formcx/mcxcl)
