1. Download the Latest Release

Beta release: MCX 0.4.9, released on Aug. 01, 2010

   Please read the [7]Release notes here. Before downloading the software,
   please read the [8]System Requirements for MCX and make sure you have
   both the hardware and software supports.

   Please download MCX v0.4.9 (aka Black-hole Beta) release at our
   [9]registration/download page. We are greatly appreciated if you can
   tell us a little bit about you and your related research by
   [10]registering your copy of mcx. Binary executable (for 32bit and
   64bit machines) and source code packages are both provided.

Stable release: MCX 0.2 (final), released on Dec 19, 2009

   Please download MCX v0.2 (Aurora) stable release at our
   [11]registration/download page.

2. Download Development Snapshot from SVN (not fully tested)

   If you want to get the latest development branch of MCX, you can
   download it from our svn. You have to be aware that an SVN snapshot is
   not a stable release. It may have partially implemented features and,
   thus, cause crash or erroneous results.

   First, make sure you have installed svn client on your system. If you
   are using a Debian-based GNU/Linux system (such as Ubuntu, Knoppix
   etc), you can install svn by
 sudo apt-get install subversion

   if you are using a Redhat-based GNU/Linux system (such as Fedora,
   CentOS etc), you can do this by
 su -c 'yum install subversion'

   If your operating system is Windows, we recommend you installing
   [12]TortoiseSVN.

2.1. Anonymous SVN Access

   The latest code snapshot can be checked out from project's SVN
   repository. This can be done anonymously by the following command.

 svn checkout --username anonymous_user https://orbit.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/svn/mcextreme/mcextreme_cuda/trunk/ mcx

   The password is the same as the username. After you checking out the
   code, you can [13]compile and run the software.

2.2. Developer SVN Access

   If you are one of the developers who have SVN write permission, you can
   checkout the latest code with the following command:

 svn checkout --username youraccount https://orbit.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/svn/mcextreme/mcextreme_cuda/trunk/ mcx

   where youraccount is your registered account in [14]orbit (of course,
   you have to [15]register first and ask the [16]project maintainer to
   grant you svn write permission).

   You can simply make changes or debug your changes in your local copy.
   If your local changes have passed review by other co-developers, you
   can then commit your changes back to the svn repository by
 cd /path/to/mcx/local/copy
 svn commit -m "a short summary of your changes"
