1. System Requirements

   In the long run, MCX will support most modern GPUs. However, at this point,
   MCX only has a CUDA version that is supported by nVidia graphics cards. In
   order to run MCX-CUDA, you have to make sure you have the right hardware and
   software support, this includes:

     * a CUDA enabled graphics card made by nVidia, a full list of supported
       cards can be found [9][here]
     * a computer running GNU/Linux, Windows or Mac OS
     * pre-installed  CUDA driver and video driver, you can download from
       [10][here]

   If you plan to purchase a graphics card that can run mcx, you can consult
   the following search links:
     * [11][8800GT series] ~ $100
     * [12][9800GT series] ~ $100
     * [13][GTX 280 series] ~ $250
     * [14][GTX 285 series] ~ $300 - $400
     * [15][GTX 295 series] ~ $400 - $500

   MCX  performs  nicely on a low-cost 8800GT card (for a given number of
   threads, MCX's speed on 8800GT is a few percent faster than the higher
   models; however, higher models allow to run more threads).

2. Running MCX

   Once you are convinced that your hardware and software support are both
   in-place, you need to setup the system environment variable in order to let
   MCX find the needed CUDA run-time library. For Linux and Mac OS users, you
   might need to add the following settings to your shell initialization file.
   Use "echo $SHELL" command to identify your shell type. For c-shell, i.e.
   csh/tcsh, add the following lines to your ~/.cshrc file
  if ("`uname -p`" =~ "*_64" ) then
          setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH "/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
  else
          setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH "/usr/local/cuda/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
  endif
  setenv PATH "/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH"

   and for "bash" or "sh" users, add
  if [[ "`uname -p`" =~ .*_64 ]]; then
          export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
  else
          export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/cuda/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
  fi
  export PATH="/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH"

   to  your  ~/.bash_profile.  If the libcudart.so file is installed in a
   non-standard folder, please replace the paths in the above scripts to your
   installation path where libcudart.so resides.

   Then,  you  can  simply start mcx by running the executable located at
   <mcx>/bin/mcx.

   To list all supported options, you just type mcx without any parameters, it
   will print the help information.

3. Compiling MCX from source code

   If you want to compile an executable on your machine from the source code,
   you should follow the steps described below:

3.1. Download the source code

   You need to first download the source code from the [16]Download page.

3.2. Install the compilers

   You need install the CUDA and C compilers on your system, this includes
     * 1. CUDA compiler and run-time libraries: this will be installed when you
       download and install the CUDA driver/sdk/tools from [17][this link]
     * 2. GNU toolchain: you need to have g++ and make commands on your system.
       Usually
          + for Debian-based Linux users, you can get these basic compiling
            tools by a single command:

 sudo apt-get install build-essential

     * for Redhat-based systems:

 sudo yum groupinstall "Development Tools"

     * for Windows users, you need to install [18][MinGW], a minimum Unix
       system on Windows, the [19][automatic-installer] can be downloaded from
       [20][here].
     * for Mac OS users, the GNU compilers can be installed from the Xcode
       tools from [21][this link]

     3. For Windows, you also need to install [22][Microsoft Visual C++ 200x
   Express Edition] (or the full version; the Express edition is free. MCX was
   tested with VC++2005).

  3.3. Setup paths

   For  Linux/Mac  OS  users, you need to make sure you have followed the
   instructions to setup the paths described in the "Running MCX" section.

   For Windows, one need to add the path to nvcc (by default, C:\CUDA\bin),
   path  to  cl.exe (by default, C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio
   8\VC\bin) and path to g++/make (by default, C:\MinGW\bin) to your Path
   environment  variable.  You can follow the screenshots as in [23][this
   tutorial], and paste the following string at the beginning of the variable
   value field.
 C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\bin;C:\MinGW\bin;C:\CUDA\bin;

   If you have installed VC2008, you need to replace "Microsoft Visual Studio
   8" to "Microsoft Visual Studio 9".

   If you have installed CUDA, MSVC or MinGW at a non-standard location, please
   open  the  Makefile  under <mcx>/src to update all the library/include
   directories to the actual path.

  3.4. make your binary

   For Linux/Mac OS, you need to open an terminal, "cd" to <mcx>/src, and type
   "make". This will compile MCX with the default option, i.e. non-atomic
   memory write, LL5 RNG and fast-math library. You can "cat Makefile" and see
   other options. If everything is working ok, you should see a binary file
   generated under <mcx>/bin.

   For Windows, you need to double click on a shortcut named "MSYS", a terminal
   will pop up. Then type "cd /path/to/your/mcx/src", then type "make". The
   binary will be generated as <mcx>/bin/mcx.exe.
