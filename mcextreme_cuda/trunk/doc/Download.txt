1. Download the Latest Release

MCX 0.2 (beta), codename Aurora

   Before downloading the software, please read the [7]System Requirements for MCX and make sure
   you have both the hardware and software supports.

   Please download the latest v0.2 (beta) release at our [8]registration/download page. We are
   greatly appreciated if you can tell us a little bit about you and your related research by
   [9][registering your copy of mcx]. Binary executable (for 32bit and 64bit machines) and source
   code packages are both provided.

2. Download Development Snapshot from SVN (not fully tested)

   If you want to get the latest development branch of MCX, you can download it from our svn. You
   have to be aware that an SVN snapshot is not a stable release. It may have partially implemented
   features and, thus, cause crash or erroneous results.

   First, make sure you have installed svn client on your system. If you are using a Debian-based
   GNU/Linux system (such as Ubuntu, Knoppix etc), you can install svn by
 sudo apt-get install subversion

   if you are using a Redhat-based GNU/Linux system (such as Fedora, CentOS etc), you can do this
   by
 sudo yum install subversion

   If your operation system is Windows, we recommend you to install [10][TortoiseSVN] (MCX v0.2
   beta currently does not support Windows, however, we anticipate to add this support very soon.)

2.1. Anonymous SVN Access

   The latest code snapshot can be checked out from project's SVN repository. This can be done
   anonymously by the following command.

 svn checkout [11]https://orbit.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/svn/mcextreme/mcextreme_cuda/trunk/ mcx

   After you checking out the code, you can compile and run the software

2.2. Developer SVN Access

   If you are one of the developers who have SVN write permission, you can checkout the latest code
   with the following command:

 svn checkout --username youraccount [12]https://orbit.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/svn/mcextreme/mcextreme_
cuda/trunk/ mcx

   where  youraccount  is  your  registered  account  in  [13][orbit] (of course, you have to
   [14][register first] and ask the [15][project maintainer] to grant you svn write permission).

   You can simply make changes or debug your changes in your local copy. If your local changes have
   passed  review  by  other  co-developers, you can then commit your changes back to the svn
   repository by
 cd /path/to/mcx/local/copy
 svn commit -m "a short summary of your changes"
