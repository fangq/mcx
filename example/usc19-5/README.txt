== USC 19-5 Brain Atlas Photon Simulations ==

In this example, we demonstrate light transport simulation in a full-head 
atlas template(USC 19.5 year group [Sanchez2012]).

This demo is identical to the MCX simulation used for Fig.9(a) in
TranYan2019.

The JSON files (.json, .jnii) utlizes the JData specifiation (https://github.com/fangq/jdata) 
to include binary data with compression support. Please download JSONLab from
