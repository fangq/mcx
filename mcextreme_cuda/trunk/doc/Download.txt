          2. [3]Download Development Snapshot from SVN (not fully tested)
                2.1. [4]Anonymous SVN Access

1. Download the Latest Release

MCX 0.2 (final), codename Aurora

   Before downloading the software, please read the [7]System Requirements for
   MCX and make sure you have both the hardware and software supports.

   Please    download   the   latest   v0.2   final   release   at   our
   [8]registration/download page. We are greatly appreciated if you can tell us
   a little bit about you and your related research by [9][registering your
   copy of mcx]. Binary executable (for 32bit and 64bit machines) and source
   code packages are both provided.

2. Download Development Snapshot from SVN (not fully tested)

   If you want to get the latest development branch of MCX, you can download it
   from our svn. You have to be aware that an SVN snapshot is not a stable
   release. It may have partially implemented features and, thus, cause crash
   or erroneous results.

   First, make sure you have installed svn client on your system. If you are
   using a Debian-based GNU/Linux system (such as Ubuntu, Knoppix etc), you can
   install svn by

 sudo apt-get install subversion

   if you are using a Redhat-based GNU/Linux system (such as Fedora, CentOS
   etc), you can do this by

 sudo yum install subversion

   If  your  operating  system  is  Windows,  we recommend you to install
   [10][TortoiseSVN].

2.1. Anonymous SVN Access

   The latest code snapshot can be checked out from project's SVN repository.
   This can be done anonymously by the following command.

 svn checkout --username anonymous_user https://orbit.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/svn/mcextreme/mcextreme_cuda/trunk/ mcx

   The password is the same as the username. After you checking out the code,
   you can compile and run the software.

2.2. Developer SVN Access

   If you are one of the developers who have SVN write permission, you can
   checkout the latest code with the following command:

 svn checkout --username youraccount https://orbit.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/svn/mcextreme/mcextreme_cuda/trunk/ mcx

   where youraccount is your registered account in [13][orbit] (of course, you
   have to [14][register first] and ask the [15][project maintainer] to grant
   you svn write permission).

   You can simply make changes or debug your changes in your local copy. If
   your local changes have passed review by other co-developers, you can then
   commit your changes back to the svn repository by

 cd /path/to/mcx/local/copy
 svn commit -m "a short summary of your changes"
